# A Wordpress Portfolio and Blog Theme
Convergence is a custom WP theme focused on providing a project-based portfolio coupled with a blog for providing smaller updates on projects and personal activities.

## Overview
This project arose out of a need to develop a clean and lightweight portfolio after ditching Wix as my personal provider. Having used their service for several years, I was frustrated with the lack of specificity in the designs I was able to create as well as the inneficient performance both in their browser editor as well as the front end. As such, I decided to utilize an open-source CMS and host my own content, allowing for greater flexibility at the cost of increased overhead and setup time. That being said, I aim to ultimately release this as a more polished and complete product for other users to iterate on and customize to their own needs. Additionally, many of the features are designed to be modular, with the goal of implementing proper block theming to allow users to build custom templates from the ground up in Gutenberg.

## Current Version
The first implementation of this theme is very limited in scope, focusing on creating a minimum viable product on which future iterations can be created. As such, many of the page linking and formatting is hard-coded into the templates. Additionally, this theme currently complies with WP's classic theme formatting, failing to adhere to the more modern block theming. This was done primarily to expedite the process of creating a prototype version, as I had limited knowledge of Wordpress to begin with and had a stronger familiarity with general PHP, CSS, and HTML.

All this being said, it is NOT RECOMMENDED that anyone fork or utilize this theme at the current time. Due to the aforementioned reasons, the theme is highly unstable, and any reported issues won't be addressed until a more stable release is created.

## Planned Updates
While the current theme is limited in scope, future updates are planned, including some of the following:
* Multiple post types to differentiate between portfolio and blog posts.
* A robust "About Me" template, allowing inclusion of previous employment, skills, and general information.
* A post ranking system, allowing posts to be marked as high or low priority, affecting their appearance when shown in a gallery or overview page.
* Proper block/Gutenberg support for all components used.
* Full accessibility support, making the website easier to use with screen readers, alternate text scaling, and other features.
* RSS support for blog posts.
* Greater user controls within the site editor, allowing users to modify shape styling without needing to delve into CSS files.
